In this lab, I used principal component analysis and k-means clusting to cluster teams with similar win percentages and find what characteristics they had in common.

This scree plot shows that one variable holds the vast majority of the data's variability, so by graphing two variables, most variability should be captured.  \

I am not able to import my graphs which separated the data because I used the plotly package for graphing, however I found that (as we would expect) teams with more yards gained had a higher win percentage, but that how those yards were gained (rushing/passing) was insignificant.
