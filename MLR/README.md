In this lab, I used multiple linear regression to predict points scored by
- passing yards
- rushing yards
- offensive penalties
- home team
- interceptions
- fumbles lost
- sacks against
- tfls against

Each of these variables were significant in the final model which had an r-squared value of 0.5112

The final model's prediction vs. actual values are seen below, with the yellow lines being a seven point error-range.
