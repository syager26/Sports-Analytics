In this lab, I used a poisson regression model to predict a team's rushing yards in a given game.  I found the probability that a team would rush for 70-90 yards, 90-110 yards, 110-130 yards, and 130+ yards.

This image below shows that the model was confident in its predictions, usually predicting a very high chance of being withen a given range (near 1) or a very low chance of being in a given range (near 0).

The model had a mean absolute error of 18.43, which is within the 20 yard range of each of the bins.
