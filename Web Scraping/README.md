In this lab, I scraped data from pro-football-reference.com to find if teams were truly drafting better players in earlier rounds.  Using the variable DrAV (weighted cummulative approximate value) and both the overall pick and round picked, I was able to show that while there are many outliers, players drafted in earlier rounds were much more likely to be more impactful, regardless of position.
